    <h2>Zip2</h2>
    In 1995, Musk, Kimbal, and Greg Kouri founded web software company Zip2 with funds from angel investors.They housed the venture at a small rented office in Palo Alto.The company developed and marketed an Internet city guide for the newspaper publishing industry, with maps, directions, and yellow pages.Musk says that before the company became successful, he could not afford an apartment and instead rented an office and slept on the couch and showered at the YMCA, and shared one computer with his brother. According to Musk, "The website was up during the day and I was coding it at night, seven days a week, all the time.The Musk brothers obtained contracts with The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune,and persuaded the board of directors to abandon plans for a merger with CitySearch.Musk's attempts to become CEO, a position held by its Chairman Rich Sorkin,

  <h2>X.com and PayPal</h2>
  <p class="paypal">
    In 1999, Musk co-founded X.com, an online financial services and e-mail payment company.The startup was one of the first online banks to be federally insured, and, within its initial months, over 200,000 customers joined the service.The company's investors saw Musk as inexperienced and had him replaced with Intuit CEO Bill Harris by the end of the year.The following year, X.com merged with online bank Confinity to prevent unnecessary competition. Due to resulting technological issues and lack of a cohesive business model, the board ousted Musk and replaced him with Thiel in September 2000.Under Thiel, the company focused on the PayPal service and was renamed PayPal in 2001.In 2017, Musk purchased the domain X.com from PayPal for an undisclosed amount, explaining it has sentimental value.

  <h2>SpaceX</h2>
  <p class="spacex">
    In 2001, Musk became involved with the nonprofit Mars Society. He was inspired by plans to place a growth-chamber for plants on Mars and discussed funding the project himself. In October 2001, Musk traveled to Moscow to buy refurbished Intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that could send the greenhouse payloads into space. He met with companies NPO Lavochkin and Kosmotras; however, Musk was seen as a novice and was even spat on by one of the Russian chief designers. The group returned to the United States empty-handed. In February 2002, the group returned to Russia to look for three ICBMs. They had another meeting with Kosmotras and were offered one rocket for $8 million, which Musk rejected. Musk instead decided to start a company that could build affordable rockets.With $100 million of his early fortune,Musk founded Space Exploration Technologies Corp., traded as SpaceX, in May 2002.As of 2021, he remains the company's CEO and also holds the title of Chief Engineer.
